datasources
===========

This is a list of data sources and data science tools for data scientists, data journalists and anyone else who is interested. I will progressively arrange this list in a more meaningful manner.

Future plans:

1. Organize better
2. Tag data and tools
3. Make searchable list (Web site)
4. Make mobile app (iPad) preloaded with the list, to allow touch-based exploration
5. Possibly have data visualizations of select data on the iPad app.

If you have any data additions to make, please feel free to clone this repo, make your changes and make a pull request. Or email me at internet.ultrageek at gmail dot com. Please use at least the subject line "Re: Github datasources repo"
